## Tools Used
- `customtkinter` for GUI.
- `undetected_chromedriver` to avoid detection.
- `selenium` to navigate

## Skills gained
- This project helped me to improve my `selenium` skills, and the abiltity to automate the web as it mainly depended on `selenium`.
- I found this cool library `customtkinter`, where it is like tkinter but with more awsome features to ease the GUI building.
